    description: 'Every shipment moves through a clear lifecycle: draft, ready, in progress, complete. Drafts save freely while you gather details, but a shipment cannot leave draft until the essentials are in place: a customer, a route or lane, a carrier, pickup and delivery dates, a reference, and any fields your shipment type requires. Moves are one step at a time, every change records who did it and when, and operational exceptions are flagged separately so they never hide the real status. Promote one shipment from its detail page, or select many and bulk-update them from the list.',

    description: 'The portal asks for exactly the right fields based on the shipment mode and flags  - LTL gets dimensions and class, hazmat reveals UN / class / packing group / proper shipping name, international adds HS code and country of origin, temperature-controlled adds min and max degrees C. As customers fill the form, density, suggested freight class, pallet positions, and linear feet calculate live. Order-level packing summary auto-generates handling units (pallets, cartons, drums, totes) from a single packaging-type catalogue. Sophisticated shippers go further with a drag-and-drop handling-unit editor: build mixed-SKU pallets, override per-unit weight and dimensions, split and merge units inline. For high-volume customers, the bulk CSV upload runs the same mode-rules validation row by row and rejects only the orders with broken lines, with row-level error messages and a downloadable template. Nothing to rekey at your end.',
