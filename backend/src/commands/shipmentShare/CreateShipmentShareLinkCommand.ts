/**
 * Mint a public share link for one shipment.
 *
 * Concurrency: nothing contends on creation. Each dispatch inserts one new row and the token is
 * 256 bits of randomness, so two concurrent creates cannot collide on the unique token hash. The
 * shipment is re-read inside the transaction so a shipment deleted or moved between the route's
 * permission check and the write cannot have a link minted against it.
 *
 * The plaintext token and access code are returned to the caller once, in the command result,
 * and are never persisted, logged, or put on the emitted event.
