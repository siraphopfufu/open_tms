/**
 * A Bill of Lading is a legal shipping document: it must name the shipper and
 * consignee and describe the goods (description, piece count, weight) for every
 * line. Ather TMS treats all of that cargo detail as OPTIONAL data throughout the
 * shipment/order lifecycle - a shipment can exist with no orders, and an order
 * can exist with no line-item weights - so a shipment can easily lack enough
 * information to produce a legally-sufficient BOL.
 *
 * A customs declaration needs exactly the same facts — shipper, consignee,
 * and a complete description of the goods — so it shares this check too
 * (#150) rather than duplicating it. It doesn't need to be gated behind BOL
 * generation itself; the underlying cargo data being complete is what
 * matters for either document.
 *
 * This is the single source of truth for "can this shipment produce a valid
 * BOL or customs form". It gates the generate endpoints (sync + async) for
 * both document types and the frontend buttons, so each button greys out for
 * exactly the shipments the backend would reject.
 *
 * Returns null if the shipment does not exist.
