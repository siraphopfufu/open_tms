/**
 * ShipmentShareViewService — builds the redacted shipment payload a share link exposes.
 *
 * The sections passed in come from the stored link, re-read on every request, never from the
 * client. This is the second half of the allowlist: the repository only queries granted sections,
 * and this service only shapes granted sections into the response. A section absent from the
 * link is absent from the payload, so a viewer cannot infer it exists from a null field.
 *
 * What is redacted regardless of sections: the customer's identity, anything financial, internal
 * notes and activity, and the consignee's contact details. A share link goes outside the
 * organisation, so locations are named down to city and country only.
