# Ather TMS Roadmap

> **Reoriented August 2026: the FinnTMS / FinnWMS split.** Ather TMS is becoming two products over
> a shared core: **FinnTMS** (transport) and **FinnWMS** (warehouse), with a possible **FinnIMS**
> (inventory) later. Architecture: modular monolith with build-time product composition, per
> [ADR 0002](docs/adr/0002-modular-monolith-product-composition.md). The sequenced programme is
> **Track 0** below, detailed in
> [docs/roadmap/split-finntms-finnwms.md](docs/roadmap/split-finntms-finnwms.md).

> **Reoriented April 2026.** Restructured around core TMS completeness - the features that make or break a credible demo. Brokerage elevated to first-class, reporting overhauled, customer portal prioritised. Speculative/advanced items (carrier risk/FMCSA, driver mobile app, digital BOL, sustainability/carbon, multi-modal ocean/air/rail, hub-and-spoke) removed or deferred to considerations.

> **WMS added April 2026.** WMS now an active track (Track 7). v1 and v2 are on the roadmap following the gap-analysis review in `docs/gap-analysis/12-WMS-GAP-ANALYSIS.md`. v3+ (slotting, LMS, yard, WCS, etc.) remains in considerations.

## Completed Work

Shipped phases (1 through 11: core TMS, orders, platform, tracking, cold chain, financials,
portals, EDI hub, maps, AI, warehouse app) have moved to the changelog at
[docs/roadmap/completed.md](docs/roadmap/completed.md). New completions append there.

---

## Active Development - Core TMS Completeness

The following tracks are ordered by impact on TMS credibility. Items within each track are sequenced by dependency.

### **Track 0: FinnTMS / FinnWMS Split** (NEW - the split programme)

Separating WMS from TMS into composable products over a shared core, per
[ADR 0002](docs/adr/0002-modular-monolith-product-composition.md). Full sequenced detail with
sizing in [docs/roadmap/split-finntms-finnwms.md](docs/roadmap/split-finntms-finnwms.md).
Roughly 50-65 PR-sized chunks end to end; every PR leaves the product shippable.

- **Phase 0: bug fixes worth doing regardless** ✅ (#130-#135, #142; merged Aug 2026) All were live bugs:
  warehouse-locations tenancy leak (missing `orgId` filter), pack-audit issues bypassing the issue
  engine (never reach triage), WMS permission family (currently none exists), issue engine
  hardcoded to `shipment` (blocks WMS issues reaching the Triage Centre), magic-link token
  scoping, qualityCentre org-scope violation
- **Phase 1: Draw the boundary in code** ✅ (#159-#173; Sep 2026) Boundary lint ✅ (#159), Prisma
  multi-file schema split ✅ (#161), DI registration split ✅ (#164), route registration
  split ✅ (#166),
  `WmsFulfilmentOrder` projection ✅ (#168), load-plan event seam ✅ (#173). One new WMS read
  model, no changes to existing tables
- **Phase 2: Data model untangling** 🚧 `Facility` (WMS off the conflated `Location`) — the
  dual-write is complete ✅, all twelve WMS models that reference `Location` now carry a
  `facilityId` (#217 storage topology, #225 inbound, #227 outbound, #229 waves), and the read path
  accepts a facility scope (#231), and the 15 WMS list pages now send `facilityId` (#234). `locationId` is
  nullable (#245) and the write path names the facility (#248); what is left is dropping the
  `Location` FKs and columns;
  `HandlingUnit` (stock without a TMS order), polymorphic `Allocation` demand ref, carton cleanup,
  `OrgWmsSettings` carve-out still to come. All expand→contract.
  Phase 0 tenancy leftovers closed alongside ✅ (#220, in #221/#222/#223): the whole WMS read and
  write surface is now scoped to `req.orgId` through ten repositories, including two deletes that
  let one tenant remove another's replenishment rules and wave templates by uuid
- **Phase 3: App shell & entitlements** 🔲 `ENABLED_MODULES` composition, `OrgApp` entitlements
  + `GET /api/v1/apps` (replaces the hardcoded frontend APPS array), `packages/contracts`,
  warehouse PWA split, delete `auth-service/`, per-product frontend builds (`VITE_PRODUCT`)
- **Phase 4: Standalone FinnWMS install** 🔲 WMS-only compose profile + seed + e2e smoke
  (receive→putaway→pick→pack); Tier 1 = dormant TMS tables; Tier 2 schema profile only when a
  customer demands it. Includes demand intake: 940/API/manifest must write WMS fulfilment orders
  directly, since a WMS-only install has no TMS order pipeline
- **Phase 5: Inventory separability (FinnIMS)** 🔲 Inventory as its own module, `Product` SKU
  master; deliberately last

### **Track 1: Brokerage Operations** (NEW - Critical Gap)

The system models the world as "shipper has carriers" but never accounts for the broker role - arguably the single most common TMS user persona. No broker margin tracking, no customer-as-shipper vs carrier-as-capacity pairing, no broker-specific workflows.

- **Broker Entity Model** ✅
  - Organization type flag: shipper, carrier, broker, 3PL (determines available features and terminology)
  - Broker-specific fields: MC number, bond info, operating authority status
  - Admin settings UI for brokerage configuration
  - Customer-as-shipper relationship: customers are the shippers in a brokerage, the broker is the intermediary
  - Carrier-as-capacity: carrier assignment represents capacity procurement, not just a transport provider
  - Broker user roles and permissions: broker_admin, broker_agent, finance, readonly system roles with hierarchical permission system (resource:action format with wildcards)
- **Broker Margin Tracking** ✅
  - Buy rate (carrier cost) vs sell rate (customer price) per shipment - leverages existing Charge + ShipmentFinancialSummary models
  - Real-time margin visibility on shipment list (togglable Revenue/Cost/Margin columns) and detail pages
  - Margin alerts: auto-create issues when margin drops below configurable threshold (MarginAlertHandler)
  - Financial columns denormalized to ShipmentReadModel for fast list queries
  - Margin reporting by customer, carrier, lane, and time period with date range filtering
  - Target margin per customer and per lane-carrier with variance tracking (actual vs target %)
- **Broker Quoting Workflow** ✅
  - Quick quote endpoint: auto-populate from lane-carrier rates via RatingService + configurable markup percentage
  - Quote-to-book conversion: "Accept & Book" creates an unassigned shipment with pre-set sell rate
  - Rate confirmation PDF generation (carrier-facing, hides customer sell rate and broker margin)
  - Customer credit check service: validates outstanding balance against creditLimitCents before quoting
  - Customer rate request intake - moved to Track 3 (Customer Portal)
- **Broker Load Board** ❌ Removed
  - The standalone Load Board page (list of unassigned shipments + quick carrier assignment) was removed in favor of assigning carriers directly from shipment creation/detail. Carrier tendering (broadcast/waterfall) remains available for larger operations.
- **Broker-Specific Financials** ✅
  - Carrier quick pay / factoring: request accelerated payment with configurable discount % and payment days
  - Customer invoice with broker markup (not showing carrier cost) - already worked via existing Invoice system
  - Carrier settlement: batch payments to carriers grouped by payment terms - already existed
  - Receivables aging from broker perspective - already existed via AR aging report
  - Commission tracking for broker agents: Commission model with accrued/approved/paid lifecycle, basis on margin or revenue, per-agent summary, management UI

### **Track 2: Reporting & Analytics** (Biggest Credibility Gap - ~40% Coverage)

The current reporting is financial-only (AR aging, carrier spend, margin analysis). Missing the operational KPIs that every TMS demo gets judged on.

- **Executive Dashboard** ✅
  - Reports app with own app switcher entry and dashboard landing page
  - Single performant API call (`GET /api/v1/reports/dashboard`) - all queries hit read models only
  - Shipment stats: total, in transit, at locations (pickup + delivery), delivered, full status breakdown with bars
  - Order stats: total with delivery status breakdown (not yet moving/in transit/delivered/exception)
  - Financial summary: revenue, cost spent, margin ($ and %), with period-over-period trend arrows
  - Invoice health: outstanding count/value, overdue count/value
  - Issue overview: active issues, critical issues
  - Billing pipeline: not invoiced / invoiced / paid counts
  - Period selector: 7 days, 30 days, MTD, QTD, YTD
  - Trend comparison vs prior period (% change with up/down arrows)
  - On-time delivery percentage (OTD%) 🔲
  - Cost per shipment / cost per unit / cost per mile trends 🔲
- **Carrier Scorecards** 🔲 (single implementation: this item supersedes the Quality Centre
  carrier scorecard page and the "carrier & lane performance scoring" entry under Intelligence &
  AI; under the split this is tms-module work)
  - On-time pickup and delivery rates per carrier
  - Tender acceptance rate and response time
  - Damage/claim rate
  - Average transit time vs quoted
  - Invoice accuracy (freight audit match rate)
  - Overall composite score with configurable weighting
  - Trend charts (rolling 30/60/90 day)
  - Exportable scorecard PDF for procurement reviews
- **Operational Reports** 🔲
  - Shipment status summary (count by status, mode, customer, carrier)
  - Lane utilization: volume and cost by lane over time
  - Dwell time analysis by location
  - Exception breakdown by type, root cause, and resolution
  - SLA compliance trends (already have SLA data, need the report view)
  - Stop performance: average load/unload times by location
- **Scheduled Reports** 🔲
  - Report scheduling engine (pg-boss cron) - daily, weekly, monthly
  - Report template selection with parameter presets
  - Email delivery with PDF/CSV attachments
  - Recipient lists (internal users + external email addresses)
  - Report history and re-download
- **Ad-Hoc Report Builder** 🔲
  - Drag-and-drop field selection from available data sources
  - Filter/group/sort configuration
  - Chart type selection (bar, line, pie, table)
  - Save and share report definitions
  - CSV/PDF export from any report

### **Track 3: Customer Portal** (Table Stakes - Currently 22%)

Every TMS needs customer self-service. The carrier portal exists but there's nothing for the shipper's customer.

- **Customer User Management** ✅
  - CustomerUser model (separate from internal User, same pattern as CarrierUser)
  - Email/password auth with dedicated JWT issuer (`ather-tms-customer`)
  - Password strength validation (8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, number), 5-attempt lockout (15 min)
  - Admin CRUD at `/api/v1/customers/:customerId/users` (list, create, update, reset-password, deactivate)
- **Customer Portal App** ✅
  - Separate app at `/customer-portal/` with its own layout and header nav
  - Dashboard with summary stats (active shipments, deliveries, issues, outstanding invoices) + recent shipments
  - All data scoped by customerId from JWT - no cross-customer access
- **Order Visibility** ✅
  - Order history with search (by order number, PO number) and status filter
  - Order detail with line items and trackable units
- **Shipment Tracking** ✅
  - Shipment list with status filter from ShipmentReadModel
  - Shipment detail with origin/destination, stops, carrier, tracking events timeline
  - Map view of active shipments 🔲
  - POD access 🔲
- **Document Access** ✅
  - Download BOLs, invoices, compliance reports from portal
  - Document list filtered by customer's shipments
- **Invoice & Payment View** ✅
  - Invoice list with amounts, paid, balance, status, due date, days overdue
  - Dispute submission (creates FinancialQuery with type customer_dispute)
- **Order Entry** ✅
  - Customer self-service order creation from portal with PO number, origin/destination, line items, service level
  - Location auto-resolution from city/state
  - **Phase 1: Order Line Items & Cartonization** ✅ (Jun 2026)
    - Surfaced existing schema gaps: hazmat detail (UN/class/PG/PSN), unit of measure, customs (HS code, country of origin), temperature range (tempMinC/tempMaxC) added to OrderLineItem
    - `ModeRulesService` drives required-ness from `(mode, flags)`: FTL/LTL/parcel × hazmat × international × temp-controlled. Same matrix evaluated client-side in the portal and re-validated server-side
    - `OrderCartonizationService` derives density, suggested freight class (NMFC density table), rolled-up class, total weight, total cube, pallet positions, linear feet, with a read-only live preview at `POST /api/v1/order-line-items/cartonization/preview`
    - `PalletType` generalised → `PackagingType` (org-scoped catalogue with `kind` discriminator: pallet | carton | crate | drum | roll | bag | tote | loose | custom). Admin CRUD at `/wms/packaging-types`
    - Order-level packing summary auto-generates `TrackableUnit`s from `(packagingTypeId, unitCount, stackable)`, so customers don't build pallets by hand
  - **Phase 2: Manual handling-unit modelling** ✅ (Jun 2026)
    - `TrackableUnit` gains optional per-unit overrides: weight, L/W/H + units, stackable
    - 8 per-unit operations promoted from repository-direct to CQRS commands (`CreateTrackableUnit`, `UpdateTrackableUnit`, `DeleteTrackableUnit`, `GenerateBarcode`, `AddLineItemToUnit`, `MoveLineItemBetweenUnits`, `MergeUnits`, `SplitUnit`). Each emits a `trackable_unit.*` event
    - `OrderProjection` subscribes to `trackable_unit.*` and recomputes `trackableUnitCount`, `lineItemCount`, `totalWeight`. Per-unit weight overrides take precedence over line-item weight sums
    - `OrderCartonizationService.computeOrderFromUnits` computes per-unit weight/cube/density/class with three-tier fallback (override → lines → packagingType external dims). Live preview at `POST /api/v1/order-line-items/cartonization/preview-units`
    - `HandlingUnitsEditor` component (shared portal + admin): drag-and-drop line items between units via `@dnd-kit`, per-unit dim/weight edit fields, create/delete/merge/split actions, generate-barcode, live cartonization summary
    - Customer portal mirrors the 8 admin endpoints under `/customer-portal/...` with customer-owns-order ownership checks
    - **Order creation with explicit `trackableUnits[].lineItems` bug fix** ✅ (Sep 2026, #269): `CreateOrderCommand`'s doubly-nested Prisma create (`order.create` → `trackableUnits.create` → `lineItems.create`) left the required `OrderLineItem.orderId` FK unset — Prisma only auto-fills the FK for the relation it directly traverses at each nesting level, not a grandparent FK two levels up — so every order creation with unit-attached line items failed outright. Fixed by creating the order first, then trackable units and their line items as separate writes with `orderId` supplied explicitly. Regression test included
  - Order templates for recurring shipments 🔲
  - **Bulk order upload (CSV) through portal** ✅ (Jun 2026, Phase 3 of Order Line Items work)
    - CSVImportService rewritten to dispatch `CREATE_ORDER` per order through the command bus (events fire and OrderProjection stays in sync; previously this was bypassed)
    - Per-line `ModeRulesService` validation: each row checked against `(serviceLevel, hazmat, international, temp-controlled)`. International derived from origin/destination country mismatch
    - All-or-nothing per order: any failing line rejects that whole order with row-level errors carrying source CSV row numbers; sibling orders still go through
    - Customer-portal endpoint at `POST /api/v1/customer-portal/orders/import/csv` forces customerId to the authed customer (rejects CSVs that declare a different one)
    - CSV template download at `GET /customer-portal/orders/import/csv/template` (admin: `/orders/import/csv/template`)
    - Full Phase 1/2 column coverage: UoM, declared value, freight class, NMFC, UN/class/PG/PSN, HS/CoO, temp range, order-level packing summary, per-unit dim/weight/stackable overrides, packagingTypeCode resolution against the org catalogue
    - Polished upload UI in both admin and portal: drag-drop, staged spinner (reading → validating → creating), per-row error display with order number tag, quick-links to created orders, template download
  - **Phase 4: Line item CQRS + weight consistency** ✅ (Jun 2026)
    - `CreateLineItemCommand` / `UpdateLineItemCommand` / `DeleteLineItemCommand` close the last CQRS gap in the order write surface. Each emits an `order_line_item.*` event consumed by `OrderProjection`
    - New `PUT /api/v1/orders/:orderId/line-items/:itemId` lets operators (and customers, via portal mirror) edit any Phase 1 field on an existing line via sparse patch, replacing delete-and-recreate
    - The two legacy `/line-items` endpoints (POST add, DELETE remove) now dispatch commands instead of hitting the repo, so the read model and audit trail finally see them
    - Weight aggregation bug fix: `OrderReadModel.totalWeight` now correctly sums `weight × quantity` per line (line weights are per-piece, matching cartonization). Unit-weight overrides still take precedence. Regression test included
- **Shipment Share Links** ✅ (Sep 2026, #155)
  - Replaces the old HMAC `/track/:token` link, which could not be revoked or expired and had no
    access control. Existing tracking URLs stop working.
  - `ShipmentShareLink` carries a hashed URL token, a scrypt-hashed access code, an expiry, a
    revoke marker and an access counter. Both credentials are shown to the operator once.
  - The sender ticks which sections the link exposes: overview, tracking events, orders, cargo,
    documents and BOL, telemetry, carrier. Financials, activity, SLA, customs and rate
    confirmations are never shareable, enforced server-side on both the write and the read.
  - Recipients enter an email address and the access code at `/share/:token`, which buys a
    two-hour viewer session scoped to one shipment (`iss: ather-tms-share`).
  - Every attempt, granted or denied, is written to the `ShipmentShareAccess` ledger. Five wrong
    codes lock the link for 15 minutes; the public routes are rate limited per IP.
  - New `shipments:share` permission gates issuing, editing, revoking and reading the access log,
    plus the Shared links tab on shipment detail.
  - Embeddable tracking widget 🔲

### **Track 4: Route Optimization & Load Planning** (Core TMS Value / ROI Pitch)

This is where TMS software earns its keep - the optimization that justifies the subscription.

- **Multi-Stop Route Optimization** 🔲
  - VROOM or Google OR-Tools integration for TSP/VRP solving
  - Optimize stop sequence for minimum distance/time/cost
  - Constraint support: time windows, vehicle capacity, driver hours
  - Compare optimized vs manual route with savings estimate
  - Re-optimize on the fly when stops are added/removed
- **Consolidation Optimizer** 🔲
  - Identify orders on similar lanes that can share a vehicle
  - Consolidation suggestions with fill rate and cost savings estimate
  - Auto-consolidation rules (same customer, same day, same lane)
  - LTL to FTL upgrade suggestions when volume warrants
- **Mode Selection** 🔲
  - Compare FTL vs LTL vs parcel for a given shipment
  - Rate comparison across modes with transit time trade-offs
  - Auto-suggest optimal mode based on weight, dimensions, and urgency
  - Mode-specific carrier ranking (best LTL carrier vs best FTL carrier for a lane)
- **Load Planning Board** 🔲
  - Visual load board: unassigned shipments ready for carrier assignment
  - Drag-and-drop shipment-to-load assignment
  - Load capacity visualization (weight, volume, pallet positions)
  - Multi-order load building with weight/cube optimization
- **Appointment Scheduling** 🔲
  - Dock scheduling and delivery window management
  - Appointment slots by location with capacity limits
  - Integration with shipment stop ETAs

### **Track 5: Cold Chain Completion** (Complete What's Started)

The cold chain infrastructure is strong (profiles, excursion detection, disposition, compliance reports, CAPA). What's missing is the regulatory UI and reporting layer.

- **Regulatory Audit Trail UI** 🔲
  - Full audit trail viewer for temperature records (CFR 21 Part 11 compliance)
  - Tamper-evident display of SHA-256 integrity hashes
  - Chain-of-custody timeline: who handled what, when, with what readings
  - Export audit trail to PDF for regulatory submissions
- **Cold Chain Compliance Reporting** 🔲
  - Customer-facing temperature compliance reports with excursion summaries
  - Regulatory export formats (FDA, USDA requirements)
  - Batch compliance reports across multiple shipments
  - Excursion trend analysis: frequency, severity, root cause by lane/carrier/product
- **Cold Chain Dashboard** 🔲
  - Real-time temperature monitoring overview (active shipments with readings)
  - Excursion alert feed
  - Compliance rate by customer/product/lane
  - Device health and calibration status overview

### **Track 6: Routes & Maps** (Enhance Existing Foundation)

Building on the existing map view, ETA monitoring, and route deviation system.

- **Route Lines on Map** 🔲
  - Draw route polylines between origin and destination on map view
  - Colour-code by status (on-time, delayed, deviated)
  - Animate in-transit shipments along route
- **Spatial Indexing** 🔲
  - PostGIS extension for inverse geofence queries (ST_DWithin with spatial index)
  - Geography column on Location model for fast spatial lookups
  - ISpatialIndexProvider interface (PostGIS default, Tile38 for scale)
  - Security event evaluation in SLA cron worker
- **Traffic & Conditions Integration** 🔲
  - Real-time traffic overlay on map view
  - Road closure and construction alerts on active routes
  - Alternative route suggestions when primary route is degraded
  - Historical traffic pattern analysis for departure time recommendations

### **Track 7: Warehouse Management System (WMS)**

Bolt-on WMS extending the TMS's TrackableUnit/CargoScan/Location models. Full specification in `docs/WMS_SPECIFICATION.md`. Gap analysis against tier-1 WMS (Manhattan, Blue Yonder, Körber, SAP EWM, Oracle WMS) in `docs/gap-analysis/12-WMS-GAP-ANALYSIS.md`. Separate app in VNext app switcher at `/wms`.

#### **v1 - Foundation** (must-ship to be credible)

- **Location Hierarchy** DONE
  - WarehouseZone, WarehouseAisle, WarehouseBin models with capacity denormalization
  - Bulk bin generation (grid pattern), walk sequence, temperature/hazmat attributes
  - Bin types: pallet, shelf, floor, dock door, staging, pack station
  - 14 command handler tests
- **Indoor Positioning (RTLS)** 🔲
  - IndoorZoneAnchor (BLE/WiFi/UWB) extending ArrivalCriteria
  - IndoorPositionHandler maps anchor hits to zones/bins on TrackableUnits

  - Cycle counting: full, zone, and random sample types, auto-adjust inventory on completion, variance detection events (5 tests)
  - Replenishment rules: min/max thresholds per SKU per pick-face bin, manual check trigger, auto-creates putaway tasks, deduplication (6 tests)
  - 🔲 QualityHold model (blocks allocation)
  - ProductUom CRUD: SKU dimensions/weights management UI, barcode/GTIN tracking, dimension lookup API for cartonization
  - CartonCatalogue CRUD: per-location carton sizes with cost tracking
  - CartonizationService: First-Fit-Decreasing recommendation (ProductUom dims -> OrderLineItem fallback), volume + weight utilization scoring, alternative carton suggestions (7 tests)
  - 🔲 ProductUom conversions (break-case operations, EA/INNER/CASE/PALLET)
  - 🔲 Auto-measure: automated dimension capture for products without UOM data (scale/dimensioner integration)
- **Receiving** DONE (partial)
  - ReceivingAppointment (scheduled dock time), ReceivingTask, ReceivingLine
  - ASN-based and blind receiving, inspection workflow
  - 10 command handler tests
  - 🔲 Manifest ingestion engine: CSV/XLSX upload, column mapping templates with header-checksum auto-detection, saved mappings per supplier/format
  - 🔲 Extends CargoScan (new scanTypes), CargoDiscrepancy (over/short/damaged)
- **Putaway** DONE
  - PutawayRule (SKU pattern, temperature, hazmat, velocity, customer, unit type)
  - PutawayTask (directed, manual, replenishment)
  - `next_available_in_zone` resolver with walk sequence + capacity + consolidation preference
  - Scan-to-confirm with deviation tracking, bin constraint validation (temperature, hazmat)
  - Auto-generates InventoryRecord + InventoryTransaction on completion
  - 9 command handler tests
- **Allocation Engine** DONE (partial)
  - Allocation model (soft/hard states)
  - Hard allocation on wave release (FIFO), multi-bin split allocation
  - 🔲 Soft allocation, FEFO/LIFO strategies, closest-to-pickface, same-lot, avoid-partial-pallet
  - 🔲 ATP (Available-to-Promise) query endpoint
- **Pick & Pack** DONE (partial)
  - Wave creation with auto-generated wave numbers, WaveOrder join
  - Wave release: hard-allocates inventory, generates PickTasks with walk-sequence-sorted PickLines
  - PickTask + PickLine with walk-sequence ordering
  - Two strategies: discrete (one task per order), batch (one task for wave)
  - Short-pick handling: backorder / cancel_line with allocation release
  - PackTask + PackLine with verification, auto-complete
  - Auto-complete cascade: line -> task -> wave
  - 9 wave/pick tests + 9 packing/loading tests
  - WaveTemplate: create templates with grouping rules, cutoff time, min/max orders, cron schedule, auto-release. Apply template to auto-create waves from eligible orders (6 tests)

  - CartonizationService: First-Fit-Decreasing recommendation with ProductUom + OrderLineItem fallback, volume + weight utilization, alternatives. Carton catalogue CRUD. Product dimensions CRUD. Recommendation wired into pack task detail page (7 tests)
  - ✅ PackAudit for weight/dim-weight variance
    - `PackAudit` model with expected/actual weight and LWH dims, computed weight and dim-weight variance percent, per-audit tolerance, verdict (pass/warning/fail), optional issueId link
    - Verdict logic: `|variance| ≤ tolerance` = pass, `≤ 2x tolerance` = warning, otherwise fail. Default tolerance 10%, configurable per-audit
    - Expected weight auto-computed from `ProductUom.weightGrams × expectedQuantity` across pack lines; caller can override
    - Dim-weight uses industry standard `(L×W×H cm) / 5000 = kg` formula; only compared when a carton is linked and all actual dims are captured
    - Warning auto-creates a medium-priority quality issue on the triage kanban; fail creates a high-priority issue - both link back to the `pack_task` via `sourceEntityType/sourceEntityId`
    - Events: `pack.audit_recorded` (every audit), `pack.audit_variance_detected` (warning/fail only)
    - Admin: `/wms/pack-audits` - sortable list with 30-day stats (total, pass rate, warnings, failures), filterable by verdict, one-click jump to the raised issue
    - Warehouse mobile: `/warehouse/tasks/pack-audit/:packTaskId` - shows expected weight, scale input, optional LWH inputs, notes, and previous-audit history. Submit returns an immediate pass/warning/fail tile
    - Routes: `POST/GET /api/v1/pack-audits`, `GET /api/v1/pack-audits/stats`, `GET /api/v1/warehouse/pack-tasks/:id/audit-context`
    - 10 command tests (expected-weight auto-calculation, verdict boundaries, override behavior, dim-weight math, validation failures)
  - ✅ `shipment.cutoff_at_risk` events
    - New `CarrierCutoff` model - per-day-of-week cutoff times with IANA timezone and optional service level + per-location override
    - `ShipmentCutoffMonitorService` evaluates open, carrier-assigned shipments against today's cutoff; projected ready time = now + (pendingPicks × 45min) + (pendingPacks × 15min) + (no load plan ? 30min : 0) - all buffers configurable
    - Severity: minor (≥30 min buffer, dashboard-only), warning (<30 min), critical (<10 min or already past)
    - Warning auto-creates a medium-priority triage issue; critical creates high-priority; both link to the shipment via `sourceEntityType: shipment`. Re-use the same issue across escalations - no spam
    - Dedup: same-severity re-notification only after a 30-min window; escalation fires immediately and reuses the existing issue
    - Events: `shipment.cutoff_at_risk` (with severity, cutoffAt, projectedReadyAt, bufferMinutes, blockingStage, pending work counts, issueId), `shipment.cutoff_cleared` (reserved)
    - pg-boss cron worker (`cutoff-monitor`, default `*/5 * * * *`, configurable via `CUTOFF_MONITOR_CRON`)
    - Admin: `/wms/cutoff-monitor` at-risk dashboard + `/wms/carrier-cutoffs` config page. Plus REST: carrier cutoff CRUD, at-risk list, single-shipment evaluate (no notify), manual full run
    - 24 tests (timezone day-of-week, local-time construction, cutoff resolution, severity bands, projected-ready calc, evaluateShipment full flow, dedup window + escalation)
- **Loading & BOL** DONE
  - StagingAssignment creation with unit location tracking
  - Batch loading completion (clears unit location - on vehicle)
  - LoadPlan model with reverse load-sequence (lines ordered by stop sequence)
  - BOL auto-generated on `load_plan.completed` via DocumentGenerationService
  - Seal capture + dock door assignment on load plan create/complete
  - BOL readiness gate (#78): a BOL is legally required cargo data, but Ather TMS treats that data as optional, so generation is blocked (sync + async endpoints) and the manual "Generate BOL" button greys out until the shipment has a shipper/consignee, attached orders, and every order line item carries a goods description, quantity, and weight. `evaluateBolReadiness` (single source of truth) drives both the API guards and the button state; missing requirements are surfaced inline on the shipment Documents tab
  - 4 command handler tests + 6 BOL readiness tests
- **Cross-dock** DONE
  - When ReceivingTask has crossDock=true, CompleteReceiving skips putaway and sorts directly to staging bins
  - Units moved to staging/shipping_dock/cross_dock zone bins
  - StagingAssignments created with order linkage for outbound routing
  - cross_dock.sorted event emitted with sort stats
  - 2 tests (cross-dock sort + non-crossdock control)
- **Returns / RMA** DONE (core)
  - Rma + RmaLine models with 7 dispositions: restock, refurb, scrap, recycle, donate, rtv, customer_keeps

  - Integration with carrier invoice (offset claim amounts against payables)
- **WMS EDI** ✅
  - EDI 940 (Warehouse Shipping Order, inbound) - `EDI940ParseService` extracts W05 header, N1 address loops (ST/SF/WH), G62 requested ship dates, W66 carrier + SCAC, NTE free-form notes, W01 line detail with UOM, G69 descriptions, N9 lot / customer line refs. `/api/v1/edi/940/inbound` dispatches `CREATE_ORDER` with `importSource: 'edi_940'`; `/preview` parses without persisting
  - EDI 945 (Warehouse Shipping Advice, outbound) - `EDI945Service` emits W06 header, N1 loops, G62 actual ship date, W27 carrier/tracking, W12 item detail with shipment status codes (CC = complete, PC = partial, CN = cancelled), line-level N9 for tracking/lot/customer refs, W03 totals. `Edi945AutoSendHandler` subscribes to `shipment.delivered` and delivers via SFTP/HTTP to any trading partner with outbound 945 enabled; `/api/v1/edi/945/generate` for manual generation

  - Customer portal restructured to multi-app layout with sidebar + topbar and an app switcher (Google-style grid) in the top-right, matching the main admin app. Two apps: Portal (orders, shipments, returns, invoices, documents, profile) and Developer (api keys, webhooks, EDI setup, integration logs)
  - **API Keys** at `/customer-portal/developer/api-keys`: self-service create, enable/disable, and revoke. Plaintext key shown once on creation with copy button. Scoped to the authenticated customer
  - **Webhooks** at `/customer-portal/developer/webhooks`: new `CustomerWebhook` + `CustomerWebhookDelivery` models. CRUD, test-delivery button, rotate-secret, expandable delivery log per webhook. Event pattern subscription with wildcards (`*`, `rma.*`, exact). HMAC-SHA256 signatures via `X-OpenTms-Signature: t=<unix>,v1=<hex>` header using signed payload `${timestamp}.${body}` - customer-side verify with 5-minute clock tolerance
  - Event fanout via `CustomerWebhookHandler` subscribing to `rma.*`, `order.*`, `shipment.*`, `invoice.*` - resolves per-customer subscribers by matching `payload.customerId` and delivers through `CustomerWebhookDeliveryService`
  - **EDI Setup** at `/customer-portal/developer/edi`: read-only view of their `TradingPartner` configuration with redacted credentials, supported transaction types, SFTP/HTTP connection details
  - **Integration Logs** at `/customer-portal/developer/logs`: paginated `EdiTransactionLog` list filtered by the customer's trading partners, with direction and transaction-type filters
  - **Developer Dashboard** at `/customer-portal/developer`: overview tiles for API keys, webhooks, trading partners, 7-day EDI activity, plus quick-start and signing/security guidance
  - 14 tests (signing, pattern matching, delivery success/failure, timeout handling)
- **Warehouse Operations Dashboard** ✅
  - Single endpoint `GET /api/v1/wms/operations-dashboard` returns six KPI groups in parallel queries
  - **Throughput** today vs last 7 days: receipts, putaways, picks, packs, shipments dispatched
  - **Cycle times** (30-day): avg pick cycle (completedAt - startedAt), dock-to-stock (putaway.updatedAt - receivingTask.createdAt), order-to-ship (first dispatch - order.createdAt), plus sample counts
  - **Quality & accuracy** (30-day): pick accuracy (completed / (completed + short_pick)), pack audit pass rate, inventory record accuracy (1 - Σ|variance| / Σ expected) computed from recent cycle count lines
  - **Live work queue**: pending pick / putaway / pack tasks, active waves, receiving-in-progress counts
  - **Exceptions**: open issues with critical breakdown, cutoff-at-risk shipments (critical + warning), returns-in-progress, open pack-audit-fail issues
  - **Capacity**: total bins, bins with inventory, utilization percent
  - Frontend page at `/wms/operations` with KPI cards grouped by section. Tone coloring (success/warning/error) on accuracy metrics and capacity utilization. Auto-refreshes every 60s. Clickable cards drill to the related operational page (picks → /wms/picking, cutoff → /wms/cutoff-monitor, etc.)
  - Sidebar entry "Operations KPIs" alongside the WMS Dashboard
  - 13 service tests (throughput windowing, cycle time math, pick accuracy, pack pass rate, inventory accuracy from cycle counts, null-sample handling, bin utilization, cutoff exception rollup)
- **Indoor RTLS Heatmap UI** 🔲
  - 2D floor-plan SVG upload per Location
  - Live markers for TrackableUnits and users via WebSocket/SSE
  - Dwell heatmap, density heatmap, 24h scrub playback
- **Pallet Types & Palletization** ✅ (foundation)
  - `PalletType` catalog model: unique `(orgId, code)`, external dimensions (mm), tare + max-load (grams), optional max stack height, material (wood/plastic/metal/cardboard/composite), reusable/ISPM-15/stackable/active flags
  - `TrackableUnit.palletTypeId` FK so pallet-level units reference their spec (nullable - legacy / ad-hoc pallets unaffected)
  - Standard pallet seed covering EUR1 (EPAL 1200×800), EUR2/3/6, US GMA (48×40), US 42×42, CHEP 1210 + CHEP 48×40, AU 1165, plastic variants, one-way export, quarter display - 13 types total with real ISO specs
  - `GET /api/v1/pallet-types/standards` exposes the seed; `POST /api/v1/pallet-types/seed-standards` bulk-adds missing rows to the org
  - `PalletizationPlanner.planHomogeneousPallet` - given a pallet type and carton spec returns cartonsPerLayer (best of 2 orientations), layers (min of height-bound and weight-bound), stacked height, total weight, weight + height utilization %, warnings (weight-first vs height-first)
  - `PalletizationPlanner.recommendPalletType` ranks active pallet types by cartons-carried, tie-breaks on weight utilization, returns `{ best, all }`
  - Endpoints: `POST /api/v1/pallet-types/:id/plan`, `POST /api/v1/pallet-types/recommend`, plus full CRUD (create/update/delete with soft-deactivation when referenced by TrackableUnits)
  - Admin page `/wms/pallet-types` - table with code, name, dimensions in cm, tare/max-load in kg, chip badges for reusable / ISPM-15 / stackable, "Load standard types" one-click seed, create/edit modal
  - 11 planner tests (orientation optimization, height limit, weight limit, utilization math, null-height-cap path, recommendation ranking, inactive filtering, tie-break)
  - 🔲 Auto-split orders across multiple pallets when volume/weight exceeds capacity (next iteration)
  - 🔲 Route-based pallet building (group by delivery stop) + reverse load-sequence integration
  - 🔲 Mobile pallet-build workflow at pack/staging (scan carton → propose pallet → confirm)
- **Container Intelligence at Pack Time** ✅ (v1 engine)
  - `CartonCatalogue` gains 8 container-intelligence fields: `temperatureZone` (any / ambient / refrigerated / frozen / dry_ice), `insulated` + `insulationHours`, `tamperEvident`, `valueClass` (any / standard / high_value), `hazmatRated` + `hazmatClasses[]` (UN class codes), `materialType` (corrugated / plastic / metal / foam / composite)
  - `ContainerIntelligenceService.recommend(items, cartons, options)` groups items into constraint-compatible packages, picks the smallest qualifying carton per group, and returns required ancillaries (gel_pack / dry_ice / desiccant / fragile_padding / tamper_seal) + special handling flags (hazmat / high_value / fragile) + per-package reasons
  - Constraint enforcement baked in: non-ambient cargo requires strict temperature match (no "any" fallback for refrigerated/frozen); hazmat cargo requires hazmat-rated carton approved for every class in the group; non-hazmat cargo is kept out of dedicated-hazmat cartons; high-value cargo requires explicit high-value carton
  - Hazmat segregation matrix (UN classes 1 / 2.1 / 2.3 / 3 / 4.1 / 4.2 / 4.3 / 5.1 / 5.2 / 6.1 / 8) splits incompatible classes into separate packages (e.g., class 3 flammables away from class 5.1 oxidizers)
  - Transit-hours upgrade: refrigerated packages heading past 24h transit automatically get dry_ice added with a warning
  - `POST /api/v1/containers/recommend` endpoint returns full package plan with volume/weight utilization and total container cost
  - Carton catalogue admin UI extended with all the new fields: temperature zone selector, insulation hours, tamper-evident toggle, value class, material, hazmat classes list, plus per-row chips in the table
  - 36 tests covering input validation, best-fit sizing, temperature grouping, hazmat segregation (compatible and incompatible class pairs), value-class routing, fragile ancillaries, multi-split combinations, reason strings, cost/weight totals
  - 🔲 Smart tote integration (IoT-paired totes assigned at pack time) - next iteration
  - 🔲 Order-line-item-driven auto-fill from SKU catalog temperature + hazmat attributes at pack time
- **Unified WarehouseTask Supertype** 🔲
  - Foundation for v2 task interleaving and LMS-aware dispatch
  - `expectedDurationSeconds` field placed now (wired in v2)
- **Warehouse Mobile App Extensions** DONE (v1)
  - Pick task execution (line-by-line with quantity confirmation)
  - Putaway task execution (scan-to-confirm destination bin)
  - Return receiving flow (scan RMA, receive per-line with qty input, auto-routes to inspection)
  - Return inspection / disposition flow (two-column disposition picker with hints, pass/fail/partial_damage, notes, customer-preferred disposition pre-selected)
  - Pack audit flow (scale input with optional LWH dims, immediate pass/warning/fail verdict, raises quality issue on variance)
  - Receiving flow (scan SKU → enter received qty + inspection status, unified across ASN and blind)
  - Packing flow (line-by-line item verification with barcode scan, carton recommendation, complete task when all lines packed)
  - Receiving appointment check-in flow (today's scheduled arrivals, one-tap check-in before receiving)
  - Barcode wedge keyboard hook (`useBarcodeScanner`) supports Zebra / Honeywell RF guns that emit rapid keystrokes + Enter
  - Unified task list with Picking / Putaway / Returns / Receive / Pack tabs; bottom nav surfaces Arrivals alongside Tasks
  - 🔲 PWA offline task queue with IndexedDB (v1.5 - needs field validation first)

- **WMS v1 Gap Close-Out** ✅
  - Wave auto-release worker - `WaveAutoReleaseService` + pg-boss cron (`wave-auto-release`, default every 5 min). Templates with `autoRelease=true` and a `releaseSchedule` (HH:MM or simple cron) + `cutoffTime` fallback fire `APPLY_WAVE_TEMPLATE` when due. `lastAutoReleasedAt` dedup stamp prevents re-firing within a 12h window. Configurable via `WAVE_AUTO_RELEASE_CRON`
  - Pack audit events (`pack.audit_recorded`, `pack.audit_variance_detected`) now subscribed by `CustomerWebhookHandler` via pack task → order → customer resolver so third-party integrations receive them as webhooks (issue creation moved after commit via `PackAuditIssueHandler` → `CREATE_ISSUE` in #131, so the issues reach the read model and triage board)
  - Receiving Appointments admin UI at `/wms/receiving-appointments` - date-filterable list with one-click check-in and cancel; new appointment form with carrier, trailer, seal, ASN reference, dock bin picker. Exposes `/api/v1/receiving/appointments/:id/check-in` and `/cancel` endpoints
  - Receiving Appointments mobile flow at `/warehouse/appointments` - today's arrivals with status chips and single-tap check-in, accessible from the bottom nav
  - Fixes from audit gaps 1-3: WaveTemplate `zonePickMode` wired end-to-end, `/cycle-counts/:id` `params` schema added, `ManifestUpload.location` relation + FK migration
  - 16 new tests (WaveAutoReleaseService: HH:MM + cron parsing, schedule-due logic, dedup window, runOnce dispatch / skip / failure paths; CustomerWebhookHandler: subscription patterns, pack task → order → customer resolver, graceful skip for missing data)

- **Event-driven auto-replenishment** ✅
  - `AutoReplenishmentHandler` subscribes to `pick_line.completed` and `inventory.adjusted`
  - Resolves location via PickTask → locationId (for pick events) or WarehouseBin → locationId (for adjust events)
  - Dispatches `CHECK_REPLENISHMENT` scoped to the affected `(locationId, sku)` so only matching rules are evaluated
  - Replenishment tasks fire the moment inventory drops - no waiting for a cron sweep - while the command-level dedup still prevents duplicate putaway tasks
  - 7 tests covering subscription patterns, both location resolution paths, direct-payload path, missing sku / missing lookup graceful skip, dispatch-error resilience

- **Customer webhook retry with exponential backoff** ✅
  - `CustomerWebhookDeliveryService.retry(deliveryId)` re-sends a failed delivery with a fresh HMAC signature and `X-OpenTms-Retry` header; increments `attemptCount` atomically
  - `findEligibleForRetry(maxAttempts, now)` selects `status='failed'` deliveries whose age has cleared the backoff window for their current attempt
  - Backoff schedule: attempt 1 → 2 min wait, 2 → 4 min, 3 → 8 min, 4 → 16 min, 5+ → capped at 30 min. Max 5 attempts before giving up
  - `webhookRetryWorker` runs every minute (`*/1 * * * *`, override `WEBHOOK_RETRY_CRON`), calls `findEligibleForRetry` then retries each one
  - 12 tests covering backoff math per attempt, cap at 30 min for high attempt counts, maxAttempts query filter, retry success + failure paths, idempotent already-delivered handling, missing-delivery error, fetch-error recording, retry header format

- **Navbar polish (v1.5)** 🔲
  - Integrations app has no transaction-type-scoped EDI shortcut (e.g. "EDI 940 received today", "EDI 945 auto-sent this week"). The universal Transaction Log at `/integrations/edi/logs` covers them via filters, but the 940/945 3PL pair is heavily used and would benefit from dedicated quick-links
  - Follow-up from WMS v1 navbar audit - LLM usage + agent prompt version history already live inline in `/settings/llm` and `/settings/agents` respectively (no gap)
  - Standalone apps (customer portal, carrier portal, warehouse mobile PWA) are intentionally outside the app switcher - not in scope for this item

#### **v2 - Differentiation** (gated on Track 0 Phase 2)

WMS v1 has shipped. v2 waits for `Facility` and `HandlingUnit` to land (Track 0 Phase 2) so it
isn't built on the conflated `Location`/`TrackableUnit` models and then re-pointed. Each item here
becomes FinnWMS product work under the module boundary rules.

  - Container return tracking: expected return date, overdue alerts
  - Integration with existing cold chain compliance system for continuous temperature monitoring through the container
- **Parcel & Compliance Labels** 🔲
  - Multi-carrier rate-shop at pack (ShipEngine or direct APIs)
  - End-of-day manifest (SCAN form, EDI 215)
  - SSCC-18 pallet labels, UCC-128 carton labels (GS1-128 barcodes)
  - Retailer-specific ComplianceLabelTemplate (Walmart, Target, Amazon routing guides)

  - Release-from-hold workflow with sign-off
  - SupplierScorecard read model (ASN accuracy, on-time, quality)
- **Cold Chain Zone Integration** 🔲
  - Zone-level SensorReading, per-zone excursion events
  - Auto-hold inventory in excursion zones

- Flutter native app (for app store distribution) 🔲
- Geofence-based auto-transition from "ready" to "in_transit" 🔲

### **IoT Integration (System Loco)**
- Device-shipment linking (associate IoT devices with shipments) ✅
- Real-time data ingestion from System Loco IoT platform (temperature, pressure, shock, light, GPS) ✅ hardened webhook pipeline (verify→enqueue→202, HMAC signature, idempotency), resolves to shipment, updates live position, enriched telemetry. See `docs/SYSTEM_LOCO_INTEGRATION.md`
- Sensor stream visualization on shipment detail pages ✅ (Telemetry tab)
- IoT-based alerts and automation (excursion alerts, geofence+sensor triggers) 🔲
- _Future:_ **Device Reports V2 feed**: continuous full-sensor snapshots + `timeSeries` arrays (denser telemetry than Device Events) 🔲

- Pluggable map provider interface 🔲

### **Internal User Auth Improvements**

- **Role & permission management UI** ✅ (#142) - create/edit/delete custom roles from /settings with a grouped permission picker (catalogue-driven, so new permission families appear automatically); system roles locked in the UI and on the API (seeder re-syncs them on boot); roles:read/roles:write guards added to all role routes, closing a privilege-escalation hole where any authenticated user could create and self-assign a '*' role
Base login (email + password, JWT, admin password reset, RequireAuth guard, global 401 → /login interceptor) is shipped. Improvements to harden and productionise:

- **Self-service password reset via email** 🔲 - `/api/v1/auth/forgot-password` is currently a stub that only logs. Implement: time-limited signed reset token, reset-password page (`/reset-password?token=...`), email delivery via the existing EmailService + EmailTemplate system, token invalidation on use, rate-limit per email.
- **First-login forced password change** 🔲 - Flag users provisioned via admin reset so they must change password on first sign-in before accessing the app.
- **MFA / TOTP** 🔲 - Optional TOTP second factor (QR code enrolment, recovery codes, enforce-per-role policy, trusted-device cookie).
- **SSO expansion** 🔲 - Google / Microsoft OAuth providers already scaffolded in the `AuthProvider` model; finish the redirect flow, domain allowlist enforcement, auto-provisioning rule, and SAML support for enterprise IdPs.
- **Session management** 🔲 - Token revocation list / server-side session records; "sign out all other devices" action; session audit in the user profile.
- **DB-backed login lockout** 🔲 - Replace the in-memory `failedAttempts` map (per-process, lost on restart) with a DB column / Redis store so lockouts survive restarts and scale across worker replicas.
- **Stronger password hashing** 🔲 - Migrate from HMAC-SHA256-with-salt to argon2id (gradual rehash-on-login, add `passwordHashAlgo` column).
- **Audit log for auth events** 🔲 - Record login success/failure, password change, password reset (by admin), lockout, token issuance, and SSO provisioning in `LoginAuditLog` with IP, user agent, outcome.
- **Password policy per organisation** 🔲 - Configurable min length, complexity, rotation days, history depth.
- **Account invitation flow** 🔲 - Admin creates user → email invite with signed acceptance link → user sets their own initial password (replaces the current "admin types a temporary password and sends it manually" workflow).
- **Login UI polish** 🔲 - "Remember me" / long-lived refresh tokens, per-tenant branded login if org has a logo, CAPTCHA after N failures.

## Priorities

0. **NOW:** **Track 0 Phase 2 (data model untangling)** - Phases 0 and 1 are done: the bug fixes
   shipped, and the boundary is drawn in code and enforced by `npm run lint:boundaries`. Phase 2 is
   the one that makes a standalone FinnWMS possible: `Facility` (WMS off the conflated `Location`),
   `HandlingUnit` (stock without a TMS order), and a polymorphic `Allocation` demand ref. 2a is
   under way, and its dual-write is finished: #217, #225, #227 and #229 put a `facilityId` on every
   WMS model that references `Location`, #231 taught every WMS list endpoint to filter by facility,
   and #234 moved the WMS UI onto it. Reads are done. Batch 6 is the write path and the contract:
   nullable `locationId`, create commands on `facilityId`, then drop the `Location` FKs.
   See [docs/roadmap/split-finntms-finnwms.md](docs/roadmap/split-finntms-finnwms.md).
1. **NEXT (Immediate):** **Carrier API Integration** - Real-time shipment tracking through carrier APIs is table stakes. FedEx/UPS/DHL first-party tracking already exist (real, sandbox-ready). Expand with **multi-carrier aggregators** (EasyPost, AfterShip) so one integration pools dozens of carriers, then broaden. Poll + webhook, all sandbox/ngrok-testable. Landscape + selection in `docs/CARRIER_INTEGRATIONS.md`; testing in `docs/CARRIER_TESTING.md`.
2. **Immediate:** **Track 1 (Brokerage)** - Broker entity model, margin tracking, quoting workflow. This unlocks the largest market segment currently unserved.
3. **Immediate:** **Track 2 (Reporting)** - Executive dashboard, carrier scorecards, on-time %. The single biggest credibility gap in a demo.
4. **Short term:** **Track 3 (Customer Portal)** - Customer user management, order entry, shipment tracking. Table stakes for any TMS.
5. **Short term:** **Track 4 (Route Optimization)** - Multi-stop optimization, consolidation, mode selection. This is the ROI pitch.
6. **Medium term:** **Track 5 (Cold Chain Completion)** - Regulatory audit trail UI, compliance reporting, cold chain dashboard. Finish what's started.
7. **Medium term:** **Track 6 (Routes & Maps)** - Route lines on map, spatial indexing. Visual polish on existing infrastructure.
8. **Shipped:** **Track 7 (WMS v1)** is done (see the v1 gap close-out). End-to-end coverage of order → warehouse → shipment → delivery exists today.
9. **After Track 0 Phase 2:** **Track 7 (WMS v2)** - 3PL billing, VAS/kitting, parcel/rate-shop, serial tracking, appointment portal. Becomes FinnWMS product work; gated so it builds on `Facility`/`HandlingUnit` rather than the conflated models.
10. **Ongoing:** EDI hub completion, audit trail, SRE/observability, AI enhancements, warehouse app improvements. Internal auth improvements pair naturally with Track 0 Phase 0 (magic-link scoping) since both land in core.

## Considerations (Outside Active Roadmap)

These items are acknowledged but deliberately deferred. They may be re-evaluated based on user demand or strategic shifts.

- **Multi-Tenancy** - Row-level security vs schema-per-tenant vs database-per-tenant. Current single-org model works for self-hosted. Evaluate when there is a concrete need for multiple paying customers on a single deployment.
- **Control Tower Dashboard** - Real-time command centre with live maps, alert streams, SLA gauges. Depends on WebSocket/SSE. Evaluate alongside brokerage operations (brokers need this).
- **Carrier Risk Scoring / FMCSA** - MC/DOT validation, insurance monitoring, safety ratings, fictitious carrier detection. Important for compliance but not core TMS table-stakes.
- **Carrier Onboarding Workflow** - Self-registration, document collection, automated validation. Nice-to-have, evaluate with brokerage (brokers onboard carriers constantly).
- **Driver Mobile App** - Mobile status updates, signature capture, photo POD, GPS tracking, offline support. Large standalone project, consider Flutter approach from warehouse app.
- **Digital BOL / e-Signature** - External eBOL provider integration, tamper-proof sharing, digital signatures. Requires choosing a legally binding signature provider.
- **Hub-and-Spoke & Multi-Modal Transport** - Location type classification, multi-modal legs (ocean/air/rail), intermodal container tracking. Significant complexity for a niche use case at this stage.
- **WMS v3+ (advanced / tier-1 parity)** - Labour management, slotting optimization, yard management, WCS/automation integration, hazmat segregation engine, serial/genealogy, voice picking, 3PL billing advanced features. See `docs/gap-analysis/12-WMS-GAP-ANALYSIS.md` for full catalogue. Core WMS v1 and v2 are now on the active roadmap below.
- **Sustainability / Carbon** - Carbon footprint calculation, emissions reporting. Regulatory pressure increasing but not yet a TMS deal-breaker.
- **Data Providers & External Feeds** - Weather, maritime, aviation, rail, traffic, market/rate data. Valuable for intelligence layer but premature before core reporting is solid.
- **Advanced Operations** - Yard management, returns/reverse logistics, claims management. Enterprise depth features for later.
- **Admin-editable Issue Types (DB-backed)** - The deterministic issue engine ships with a code-defined Issue Type registry (key, priority, latching, raise threshold/window, trigger + recovery events). Promote this to a DB-backed `IssueType` table with an admin CRUD UI so orgs can add/tune their own issue types (thresholds, latching, severity) without a code change. Deferred from the initial issues redesign to keep v1 deterministic and simple.
