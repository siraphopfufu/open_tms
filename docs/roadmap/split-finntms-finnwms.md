# Split Programme: FinnTMS / FinnWMS over a Shared Core

The sequenced plan for separating WMS from TMS so each can ship as its own product, per
[ADR 0002](../adr/0002-modular-monolith-product-composition.md) (modular monolith, build-time
product composition). Announced in the `ather-tms-is-changing` article.

**Governing rule: the product runs and ships at the end of every PR.** All schema work is
expand then contract. Sizing: 1 chunk = one focused PR (one GitHub issue, one worktree).

## Why (short version)

- FinnTMS and FinnWMS become separable products. At least one prospect wants WMS + Inventory +
  Issues only, so standalone WMS installs must be possible.
- Three conflated models block it today: `Location` (geo node vs facility root), `TrackableUnit`
  (stock can't exist without a TMS order), and `Allocation` (hard FK from stock to demand).
- Clean seams already exist: a contiguous WMS schema block, ~55 WMS event types with zero
  cross-domain subscribers, and soft string ids across most of the seam.

## Phase 0: pay now regardless ✅ (shipped Aug 2026: #130, #131, #132, #133, #134, #135, plus #142 roles UI found along the way; #137 PWA token bug filed as follow-up)

These were live bugs. Done ahead of any split work.

| Item | Detail | Size |
|---|---|---|
| Tenancy leak | `GET /api/v1/warehouse/locations` (`backend/src/routes/warehouse.ts:714`) has no `orgId` filter and returns every tenant's locations. Route through `registerOrgScope`/`req.orgId`; audit sibling handlers | S |
| Pack-audit issue bypass | `RecordPackAuditCommand` does a raw `tx.issue.create` with invalid `category: 'quality'`, bypassing the issue engine, so these issues never reach `IssueReadModel`/triage. Route through the issue command path; backfill orphans | S-M |
| qualityCentre org scope | Replace forbidden `prisma.organization.findFirst()` with `req.orgId` | S |
| Triage accepts WMS issues | `IssueEngineHandler` hardcodes `sourceEntityType: 'shipment'`; `TriageAgentHandler` patterns exclude WMS events. Fix both. This is one of the end-state requirements and it can be done now | M |
| WMS permissions | None exist: `/api/v1/wms*` is open to any authenticated user. Add a `wms.*` permission family; grant permissively to existing roles, tighten later | M |
| Magic-link scoping | Warehouse PWA magic links mint full internal JWTs. Mint warehouse-scoped tokens; accept both during transition | M |

### Phase 0 leftovers, closed Sep 2026 (#220)

The Phase 0 tenancy sweep fixed `GET /api/v1/warehouse/locations` (#130) but stopped there. The
rest of the WMS surface had the same bug and was found while scoping Phase 2a batch 2. Closed in
#221, #222 and #223.

Every WMS list filtered on a **client-supplied** `locationId` and nothing else, and every detail
fetch was `findUnique` by bare id: putaway, receiving, waves, picking, packing, staging, cycle
counts, load plans, replenishment, wave templates and both dashboards. `registerWmsGuard` proves
only that the caller holds `wms:read`/`wms:write` in *some* organisation, and that was mistaken for
a tenancy check.

Four things were worse than unscoped reads:

- `replenishmentRule.delete` and `waveTemplate.delete` ran `where: { id }` with no org filter,
  wrapped in `.catch(() => null)`. One tenant could delete another's rules and templates by uuid,
  silently
- `/api/v1/wms/operations-dashboard` resolved the org with `prisma.organization.findFirst()`, so
  every tenant saw whichever organisation sorts first
- `(req as any).orgId || 'default-org'` meant a request arriving without scope was filed under a
  literal `'default-org'` rather than rejected
- `(req as any).userId` is never populated anywhere in the codebase, so every WMS command was
  attributed to `'system'` rather than the acting user

Ten repositories now hold the scope (`PutawayRepository`, `ReceivingRepository`, `WaveRepository`,
`PackingRepository`, `CycleCountRepository`, `LoadPlanRepository`, `ReplenishmentRuleRepository`,
`WaveTemplateRepository`, `WmsDashboardRepository`, `FacilityRepository`), none with an unscoped
variant, and thirteen writes moved onto the command bus. Eight event types that were declared but
never emitted now fire.

**This was not optional groundwork for Phase 2a.** Batches 2 to 4 rewrite the same query sites, and
doing the tenancy fix first means each batch is a mechanical `facilityId` addition rather than a
migration tangled up with a security fix.

Around 90 `organization.findFirst()` calls remain across TMS routes and services. That is #117, and
it is considerably larger than its title suggests.

## Phase 1: draw the boundary in code ✅ (shipped Sep 2026: #159, #161, #164, #166, #168, #173)

Order: lint, then schema file split, then DI/routes split, then projection, then load-plan seam.

1. **Boundary lint** ✅ (#159) `npm run lint:boundaries` walks backend imports against the ADR 0002
   DAG, plus `.claude/rules/module-boundaries.md`. Seven known leaks seeded into
   `backend/src/tooling/moduleBoundaries/exceptions.json` as the burn-down: charges to rating,
   cold chain to CAPA, load plans to document generation, two on the Location conflation, and
   manifest ingest to receiving. Import-graph only for now; Prisma model ownership comes with the
   schema file split below. (S)
2. **Prisma multi-file schema split** ✅ (#161) `prisma/schema/` under the `prismaSchemaFolder`
   preview feature, one file per module rather than the three originally planned, so the schema
   matches the map the boundary lint enforces in code: core 35 models, tms 66, wms 24, finance 11,
   quality 7, inventory 4. `prisma migrate diff` empty in both directions, 56 migrations still
   resolve. Also produced the cross-boundary FK list below. (S-M)
3. **Split DI registration** ✅ (#164) `di/registry.ts` into `di/modules/<module>.ts`, one per
   module, each registering its own bindings and command handlers. The registry is now a 55-line
   composition root. The per-module files are checked by the boundary lint rather than exempt.
   Verified by diffing the 87 container bindings and 152 registered command types before and
   after. (M)
4. **Split route registration** ✅ (#166) `index.ts` into `routes/modules/<module>.ts`, each
   exporting its public and its JWT-scoped registrations. index.ts drops from 570 to 375 lines and
   keeps only the server lifecycle. Verified by booting the server and diffing the full route
   table: 717 routes, identical. (S)
5. **`WmsFulfilmentOrder` projection** ✅ (#168) First WMS read model, fed by `order.*` and
   `order_line_item.*` through `IFulfilmentDemandSource`, a core port TMS implements, so the
   projection never touches a TMS model. `CreateWave`, `ApplyWaveTemplate` and `ReleaseWave` now
   read it. The backfill runs the projection itself. Also closed a live cross-tenant bug: wave
   template eligibility ran with no `orgId` filter on either half of the query. (L)
6. **Load-plan seam** ✅ (#173) `CompleteLoadPlanCommand` emits `load_plan.completed` carrying
   `bolRequested`, and `BolGenerationHandler` on the TMS side generates the BOL, links it and
   emits `load_plan.bol_generated` (schema v2). First deliberate cross-domain subscriber,
   idempotent by conditional claim. Burns down the load-plan leak: 7 exceptions to 6. The
   `ShipmentStopPort` half was not needed; `CreateLoadPlanCommand` reads staging assignments and
   trackable units, not shipment stops. (M)

## Phase 2: data model untangling (~18-26 chunks)

This is the phase that makes standalone WMS possible.

### The foreign keys that have to go

Taken from the schema folder on 2026-09-01, after the split in #161. Every FK crossing the tms/wms
boundary runs through `TrackableUnit`, which is exactly the model 2b splits:

| Edge | Count | Where they are |
|---|---|---|
| wms to tms | 5 | `PackLine`, `PickLine`, `PutawayTask`, `ReceivingLine`, `StagingAssignment`, all to `TrackableUnit` |
| tms to wms | 2 | `TrackableUnit.currentBin`, `TrackableUnit.currentZone` |
| wms to core | 12 | every warehouse root pointing at `Location`, which 2a re-points at `Facility` |
| inventory to tms | 3 | `Allocation.orderLineItem` (2c), plus two `TrackableUnit` refs |
| finance to tms | 6 | charges, commissions and carrier invoices reaching shipments, orders and carriers |
| core to tms | 1 | `AuditLog.order`, which is a stray and should be a soft id |

Seven FKs and one model stand between the two products.

- **2a. Location to Facility (XL, 6-9):** add `Facility`, backfill one per WMS-referenced
  Location, add nullable `facilityId` to the WMS models (batched by subdomain), dual-write,
  switch reads to an org-scoped `/api/v1/facilities`, migrate the WMS frontend off unfiltered
  `/api/v1/locations`, then contract after soak. Highest-risk item; batching is the mitigation.

  Re-baselined 2026-09-03 against the schema as it stands after #161. The original sizing (17
  models, 19 frontend files) was taken before the schema split; the real counts are **26 WMS
  models, 13 of them referencing `Location`, and 27 frontend files calling `/api/v1/locations`**.
  Batches:

  | # | Batch | Models | Status |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | 1 | Storage topology | `WarehouseZone`, `WarehouseAisle`, `WarehouseBin` | ✅ #217 |
  | 2 | Inbound | `ReceivingTask`, `ReceivingAppointment`, `PutawayTask`, `PutawayRule` | ✅ #225 |
  | 3 | Outbound | `PickTask`, `PackTask`, `StagingAssignment` | ✅ #227 |
  | 4 | Waves | `Wave`, `WaveTemplate` | ✅ #229 |
  | 5a | Read path | WMS list endpoints and repositories accept a facility scope | ✅ #231 |
  | 5b | Frontend | the 15 WMS list pages onto `/api/v1/facilities` | ✅ #234 |
  | 6a | Nullable | `locationId` nullable on the 14 WMS models | ✅ #245 |
  | 6b | Write path | create commands and the WMS create forms onto `facilityId` | ✅ #248 |
  | 6c | Contract | drop the `locationId` parameter, the `Location` FKs and the columns | next |

  6a had to come first: a command cannot stop writing `locationId` while the column is NOT NULL.
  Making it nullable surfaced three places that assumed it was always there, and one more unscoped
  command (`warehouse_bin.update` reached its bin by bare id). It also found the hard limit on this
  phase: **`InventoryRecord` is still keyed on Location and has no facility**, so putaway, returns
  and wave release cannot work in a Location-free install until Phase 4 gives inventory a facility.

  5b turned out to be 15 pages, not 19: the other four are create forms whose `locationId` feeds a
  command payload, so they stay on Locations until batch 6 moves the write path. That makes the
  rule for this phase crisp: **reads by facility, writes by location, until the contract.**

  Batch 5 was one row when this table was written; it is two. Doing the backend first means the
  frontend change lands against an API that already accepts what it wants to send, and neither PR
  breaks the running product. Note also that only **19** of the 27 frontend files are WMS; the
  other 8 are TMS pages that use `/api/v1/locations` legitimately and stay on it.

  5a also closed the last of the tenancy debt: `WarehouseZoneRepository` was missed by #220
  entirely, and every read on it was unscoped.

  Batch 4 listed `WmsFulfilmentOrder` when this table was written. It has no `locationId` and no
  `Location` relation, so it needed nothing. **The dual-write is now complete: all twelve WMS
  models that reference `Location` carry a `facilityId`.** Batch 5 is the first one that changes
  behaviour, so it wants a soak between the backfill and the switchover rather than shipping both
  at once.

  Chunk 1 (#217) added `Facility` with a soft `sourceLocationId`, nullable `facilityId` on the
  three topology models, a migration that backfills one facility per referenced Location taking
  each row's `orgId` from its own source record, `facility.*` commands and events, an org-scoped
  `/api/v1/facilities`, and dual-write on the three topology create paths. Reads still go through
  `locationId`.

  Batches 2 to 4 are now cheaper than chunk 1 was. Every model they touch carries both `orgId` and
  `locationId`, so there is no `orgId` derivation problem like `WarehouseAisle` had;
  `resolveFacilityForLocation` already exists; and #220 moved every write in those files onto the
  command bus, so the dual-write has one place to go in each case rather than several.

  Batch 2 (#225) bore that out: four nullable columns, five create paths, and a backfill that is a
  no-op wherever chunk 1 already made the facility. Two things worth carrying into batch 3:

  - **Not every create path is a create command.** Two of the five were `putawayTask.create` calls
    inside `CompleteReceivingCommand` and `CheckReplenishmentCommand`, both in loops. Search for
    the Prisma create, not for the command named after the model.
  - **#220 scoped the routes and repositories, not the queries inside command handlers.** Batch 2
    found seven more unscoped reads and one unscoped write in the commands it touched, including
    `receiving_task.complete` looking its task up by bare id, and `receiving_task.create` moving
    another tenant's appointment to `receiving`. Expect the same in the outbound commands and fix
    them as part of the batch rather than filing them.

  Batch 3 (#227) confirmed the second point and found the worst instance of it: `wave.release`
  allocated inventory on `locationId` and SKU alone, so releasing a wave hard-allocated another
  tenant's stock and decremented their `quantityAvailable`. Five more, including
  `staging_assignment.create` moving another tenant's `TrackableUnit` into our staging bin.

  Batch 4 (#229) found one more, `wave_template.apply` looking its template up by bare id, which
  built the wave on another tenant's floor. **That is 21 across the four batches, all of them
  inside command handlers that #220 did not reach.** The pattern is stable enough to state as a
  rule: a command that looks its aggregate up with `findUnique({ where: { id } })` is a tenancy
  bug, and `locationId` alone is never a sufficient filter.

  The one awkward case remaining is `TrackableUnit`, which has no `orgId` and can only be scoped
  through its order. That is the argument for 2b, and it is worth doing soon.
- **2b. TrackableUnit split (L-XL, 5-7):** new WMS `HandlingUnit` (standalone LPN with soft
  order/shipment refs), backfill and dual-write, switch receiving/putaway/inventory, then drop the
  WMS FKs to TrackableUnit. **Split it; don't make `orderId` nullable as a shortcut.** The cascade
  delete on stock-referenced rows is the real hazard. TrackableUnit keeps its name and stays TMS.
- **2c. Allocation soft demand ref (M, 2-3):** `(demandType, demandId)` replaces the
  `orderLineItemId` FK. Dual-write, switch, drop the FK, keep an index.
- **2d. Carton cleanup (M, 2-3, parallelizable):** `CartonCatalogue` (WMS box master) and
  `PackagingType` (TMS rating/palletisation) stay separate models. Rename the two cartonization
  services honestly, move the PackagingType UI out of `/wms/` nav, and add the missing FK on
  CartonCatalogue.
- **2e. `OrgWmsSettings` carve-out (M, 2-3):** move `magicLinksEnabled`, `warehouseScanMode`,
  `trackableUnitType`, etc. out of `Organization`. No full god-model split.

## Phase 3: app shell, entitlements, package seams (~8-11 chunks, interleaves with Phase 2)

1. Env-driven module composition: `ENABLED_MODULES=core,tms,wms` gating DI/route registration
   (default all-on, no behaviour change)
2. `OrgApp` entitlements table, a `requireApp()` decorator, and `GET /api/v1/apps`; the hardcoded
   frontend `APPS` array becomes a render of that response
3. `packages/shared` becomes `packages/contracts` with `{core,tms,wms}` subpaths
4. Warehouse PWA split into a shell plus per-domain screen registries (TMS shipment-launch vs WMS
   tasks)
5. Delete the dormant `auth-service/`
6. Frontend per-product builds: `frontend/src/apps/*` with lazy imports; `VITE_PRODUCT` selects
   manifests and brand tokens; replace the `authFetch.ts` monkey-patch with an explicit `apiClient`

## Phase 4: standalone WMS install (~5 chunks on the recommended fork)

- **Fork A (recommended): modular monolith.** Same binary, `ENABLED_MODULES=core,inventory,wms`,
  FinnWMS-branded frontend, full migrations with dormant TMS tables (Tier 1). WMS-only
  docker-compose profile, seed, and an e2e smoke running receive, putaway, pick, pack.
- **Fork B: separate repos/DBs/broker.** Only if a customer or scale forces it (+15-25 chunks and
  permanent 2x ops load). Phases 1-3 make it possible later without rework. Do not take it
  speculatively.
- Tier 2 (a composed WMS-only schema profile with zero TMS tables) only when contractually
  demanded.
- **Demand intake for standalone installs (new item, found 2026-08-16):** EDI 940, the customer
  API, and manifest upload all create demand via the TMS `CREATE_ORDER` command today. A WMS-only
  install has no TMS order pipeline, so these intakes must be able to write WMS fulfilment orders
  directly. Without this, the Phase 4 smoke test has nothing to pick. (M)

## Phase 5: inventory separability / FinnIMS (~4-6 chunks, deliberately last)

Needs 2a, 2b, 2c and 3.1. Inventory models move to their own fragment and `register.ts`; introduce
the `Product` SKU master (today `sku` is a bare string everywhere); WMS consumes availability via
ports and events. Don't design this in detail yet; Phase 2 outcomes will reshape it.

## What NOT to do

1. No Fork B preemptively (separate repos/DBs/brokers/outbox)
2. Don't resurrect `auth-service/`; delete it
3. Don't split the whole Organization table; carve `OrgWmsSettings` only
4. Don't make `TrackableUnit.orderId` nullable as a shortcut
5. Don't build read models/subscribers speculatively; the unused WMS event types can stay unused
   until something actually consumes them
6. Don't big-bang rename models for purity
7. Don't rewrite the warehouse PWA; split it
8. Don't add a feature-flag framework; module flags plus `OrgApp` entitlements suffice

## Totals

Working standalone FinnWMS on Fork A: roughly **50-65 focused PR-chunks**. About 10 of them
(Phase 0) are correctness and security fixes worth doing immediately regardless.
