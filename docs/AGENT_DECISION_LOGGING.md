# Agent Decision Logging, Automation Rules & Skills

## Architecture

Every AI agent decision is logged through a dedicated "decision endpoint" for compliance and
automation discovery. The system captures: what was decided, why (reasoning), what context the agent
had, what action was taken, and the outcome (recorded later via human review).

## Key Concepts

- **Decision** - A logged judgment call by an AI agent, including full reasoning chain and context
  snapshot
- **Outcome** - Human review of whether the decision was correct/incorrect/partially correct
- **Promotion** - "Graduating" a proven decision pattern into a deterministic automation rule (no AI
  needed)

## Decision Flow

1. Agent receives trigger (domain event, schedule, manual)
2. Agent gathers context, calls LLM, produces decision
3. Decision logged via `POST /api/v1/agent-decisions` (the "decision endpoint")
4. Human reviews and records outcome via `PUT /api/v1/agent-decisions/:id/outcome`
5. Proven patterns promoted to automation via `POST /api/v1/agent-decisions/:id/promote`

## Triage Agent

The first agent implementation (`TriageAgentHandler`) subscribes to exception events and uses Claude
to triage them. It can create issues, escalate existing ones, or take no action. Every decision is
logged for compliance.

In the shipment-exception domain the triage agent acts as an **enricher** on issues raised by the
deterministic Issue Engine, not as a creator - see `ISSUE_ENGINE.md`.

**Enable:** Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env var. Optionally `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`.

**Subscribed events:** `shipment.exception`, `sla.breached`, `cargo.misdrop_detected`,
`cargo.missing_at_stop`, `cargo.left_on_vehicle`, `cold_chain.excursion_detected`

## Shipment Assistant (ผู้ช่วย AI)

A read-only chat assistant at `/assistant` (`POST /api/v1/assistant/chat`). Claude answers a
dispatcher's question by calling tools that read the org's jobs; it cannot change anything.

- **Tools** (`services/assistant/assistantTools.ts`): `search_jobs`, `get_job`,
  `list_ready_to_invoice`, `list_unsettled_advances`, `revenue_summary`. The executor always passes
  `req.orgId`; no tool input can select an org. Inputs are validated with zod, and amounts are
  returned in baht.
- **Loop** (`services/assistant/ShipmentAssistantService.ts`): at most 6 model calls per question,
  adaptive thinking at `medium` effort, and a system prompt cached with an explicit breakpoint. A
  tool that throws becomes an error result, never a failed request.
- **Logging:** every answered question is an `AgentDecision` with `agentType: shipment_assistant` and
  `actionType: answer_question`, so it shows in the decision history tab.
- **Limits:** 20 requests per user per minute, at most 20 turns of history, 2,000 characters per
  message.

**Enable** with `ASSISTANT_PROVIDER`:

| Value | Endpoint | Auth | Default model (`ASSISTANT_MODEL` overrides) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `bedrock` | Claude in Amazon Bedrock (`bedrock-mantle.{region}.api.aws`) | AWS credential chain; the ECS task role in production needs `bedrock-mantle:CreateInference` | `anthropic.claude-opus-5` |
| `anthropic` | Claude API | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (and `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` to point at a mock) | `claude-opus-5` |

With neither set, `/api/v1/assistant/status` reports `enabled: false` and the page says so. The E2E
stack runs it against `e2e/mock-claude.ts`, a scripted Messages API, so CI never calls a real model.

## Configurable Agent Prompts

Agent behaviour is configurable per-org via `AgentConfig` + versioned prompts
(`AgentConfigVersion`). The handler subscribes broadly to wildcard event patterns and filters
against config at runtime (no worker restart needed).

**Configurable:** system prompt (with `{{event}}`, `{{shipment}}`, `{{issues}}`, `{{sla_status}}`
template variables), subscribed events (checkboxes), temperature, max tokens, confidence threshold,
deduplication window, enabled toggle.

**Prompt versioning:** Every prompt change creates an immutable version. Each `AgentDecision` links
to the version that produced it via `promptVersionId`. Rollback by activating any previous version.

**Auto-seed:** Default config with hardcoded prompt is created on first worker startup if none
exists.

## Automation Rule Engine

Deterministic rules promoted from agent decisions. Rules use the same unified condition format
(`{field, operator, value}`) as agent-extracted conditions. When a rule matches an event, it executes
instantly without an LLM call. Rules suppress the triage agent for matched events via deduplication
markers.

**Condition evaluation:** `ConditionEvaluator` supports operators: `equals`, `notEquals`, `contains`,
`in`, `greaterThan`, `lessThan`, `greaterThanOrEqual`, `lessThanOrEqual`, `exists`, `notExists`.
Handles nested field paths (`payload.delayMinutes`, `context.shipment.status`).

**Rule priority:** Rules are evaluated in priority order (1-100, lower first). First matching rule
executes, remaining are skipped.

**Promote flow:** When a user promotes an agent decision, the `matchedConditions` from the LLM
response are extracted and pre-fill the automation rule. The
`POST /api/v1/automation-rules/from-decision/:id` endpoint handles this.

## Skills System

Extensible action framework. Skills are discrete, configurable action units with templated fields.

**ISkill interface:** Each skill has a `definition` (fields, configSchema, requiresConfig),
`validateConfig()`, and `execute()` method. New skills are registered in the `SkillRegistry`.

**Built-in skills:** `create_issue`, `escalate_issue`, `add_comment`, `contact_driver`, `send_email`
(requires email config), `call_webhook` (requires URL config).

**Template resolver:** All skill fields support `{{field.path}}` syntax resolved against event +
context data. Same variable format as agent prompts.

**Skill chains:** Ordered sequences of skills with question branching. Question nodes evaluate
conditions (same `RuleCondition` format) and follow matched/unmatched branches. `SkillChainExecutor`
walks the chain.

**Skill config:** Org-level configuration for skills that need API keys, webhook URLs, etc. Managed
via `/settings/skills` admin page.
